## Goal 

- Identify context dependent senteces from monolingual data. 

## Process
- In case of monolingual data, use attention weights from a pretrained BERT-like model to estimate 'amount' of depency of sentence on its context. 
- Then build a model with the attention weights as inputs to classify whether given sentence depends on its context (and therefore sentence-level translation most likely will not work).
